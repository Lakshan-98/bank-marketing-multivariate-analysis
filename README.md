This project presents a multivariate statistical analysis of a real-world dataset from a Portuguese bank‚Äôs telemarketing campaigns. The dataset includes customer demographic information, financial attributes, economic indicators, and campaign-related variables. The objective is to explore patterns in client behavior and predict term deposit subscriptions using advanced multivariate methods.

A variety of techniques were applied to reduce dimensionality, uncover latent variables, classify customer behavior, and segment clients into meaningful groups. These methods provide both predictive and descriptive insights that support data-driven marketing strategies.

üîç Objectives:
Analyze customer behavior using multivariate statistics

Identify key features influencing term deposit subscription

Segment customers for more effective marketing targeting

Visualize high-dimensional data patterns and structure

üß™ Techniques Used:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduced data complexity and revealed key contributing variables

Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Identified and validated latent factors

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Built a classification model to distinguish between subscribers and non-subscribers

K-Means Clustering: Segmented customers into distinct behavioral groups

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA): Explored relationships between customer profiles and campaign engagement

üìà Key Outcomes:
PCA highlighted variables such as duration, poutcome_success, and economic indicators as influential

LDA demonstrated effective classification of customers based on subscription likelihood

Cluster analysis revealed customer segments that can support personalized marketing

CCA showed meaningful links between demographic traits and campaign performance

üõ† Tools:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, factor_analyzer, semopy
